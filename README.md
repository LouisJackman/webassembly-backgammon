# WebAssembly Backgammon

I wanted to learn both WebAssembly and Backgammon, hence this project.

It requires:

* Make
* POSIX Shell, i.e. a Bourne-compatible shell.
* The [WebAssembly Binary Toolkit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)'s
  programs in `$PATH`.

Run `make help` for the available tasks for building and running the game.

This repository is currently hosted [on
GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/louis.jackman/webassembly-backgammon). Official
mirrors exist on
[SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~louisjackman/webassembly-backgammon) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/LouisJackman/webassembly-backgammon). At the
moment, GitLab is still the official hub for contributions such as PRs and
issues.
