# WebAssembly Backgammon

I wanted to learn both WebAssembly and Backgammon, hence this project.

It requires:

* Make
* POSIX Shell, i.e. a Bourne-compatible shell.
* The [WebAssembly Binary Toolkit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)'s programs in `$PATH`.

Run `make help` for the available tasks for building and running the game.
